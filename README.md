# Regression-Model
In this project, we take a look at a data set of a collection of cars, we aim to explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). At the completion of the project, we shall answer the following two questions: 1. “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?” 2. “what value(s) Quantifies the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?”
